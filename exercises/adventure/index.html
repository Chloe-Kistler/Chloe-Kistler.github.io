        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>
            You were walking to the well outside your house to get the
            water for the day. You were in a rush and didn't pay attention 
            to the rocks near the well. You trip, and find yourself falling 
            down into the well. You get up, brush yourself off and notice 
            something strange, the well has a tunnel. What will you do?
        </p>
