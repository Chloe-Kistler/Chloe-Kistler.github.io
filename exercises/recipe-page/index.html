        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>

        <h3>MAKING THE RICE CAKES</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by mixing sweet rice flour and salt in a 
                large bowl. Gradually add hot water, stirring with 
                a wooden spoon or spatula until the mixture comes together 
                into a dough. The dough should be slightly sticky but firm 
                enough to hold its shape.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the dough to a clean surface and knead it for
                about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. If the dough 
                is too sticky, dust your hands with a bit of rice flour 
                as you knead.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the dough into small portions and roll each one
                into a long, thin cylinder, about the thickness of your 
                thumb. You can cut the cylinders into smaller, bite-sized
                pieces now.
            </li>
            <li>
                To prevent sticking, lightly coat the rice cakes with 
                sesame oil. This also helps to keep them tender during cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the rice 
                cakes and cook them for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until 
                they float to the surface and become chewy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain the rice cakes and rinse them under cold water to stop 
                the cooking process. Set them aside while you
                prepare the sauce.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>MAKING THE SAUCE</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large pan or skillet, melt the unsalted butter over
                medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until it 
                becomes fragrant and lightly golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in the hot water, gochujang paste, and gochugaru. 
                Stir everything together until the gochujang is fully
                dissolved, and the sauce starts to simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the white sugar to balance out the heat from the 
                gochujang and gochugaru. Stir until the sugar
                dissolves completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, stir in the grated parmesan and heavy cream.
            </li>
            <li>
                Taste the sauce and add a pinch of salt if needed. Let 
                the sauce simmer for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>ASSEMBLING THE RABOKKI</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                While the sauce simmers, add the ramen noodles and rice cakes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let them simmer for about 5 minutes to absorb the 
                flavors and fully cook.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once cooked, sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the 
                top of the rabokki. Reduce the heat to low and cover the 
                pan, allowing the cheese to melt and become gooey.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top the dish with a fried egg. Garnish the rabokki with 
                chopped green onions and sesame seeds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately while it’s hot!
            </li>
        </ol>
