            <h2>Recap: What to remember from season 4</h2>

            <p>
                You asked, we are here to tell. Stranger Things season 
                4 may seem like a lifetime ago, but don’t worry, we can 
                fix that. To make things easier on the brain, let’s break 
                this up into three parts!
            </p>

            <h4>Part One: Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and Chapter 3</h4>

            <p>
                In episode one of Stranger Things season 4, you are brought 
                with the cast to two different locations, well, three. We 
                will get into that. For the first location, you have Mike, 
                Dustin, and Lucas all still in Hawkins, where they introduce 
                you to a couple of new characters. At Hawkins High School, we 
                meet Eddie Munson and Mason Dye. Both characters represent 
                the typical jock/nerd dynamic of the 80s. Eddie is a 
                misunderstood nerd and the leader of the Dungeons and Dragons 
                “Hellfire Club”. While Mason is the typical popular, mean 
                basketball star of the high school.
            </p>

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Will, Joyce, Eleven, and Jonathan have moved to 
                California to get away from Hawkins. We also meet a new 
                character here named Argyle.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the new cast introduced, we are also slowly introduced 
                to Eleven’s background story, little by little. We are also 
                introduced to the new villain, Vecna. Going into episode two, 
                we find out that the beloved character, Hopper, is alive and 
                somewhat well. He has been taken by the Russians and has 
                been brought to a Russian prison camp. In this episode, Mike 
                visits Eleven in California and discovers not everything is 
                as peachy as Eleven made it seem. And back in Hawkins, a 
                body is discovered.
            </p>

            <p>
                By the end of episode three, Joyce and her sidekick Murray 
                find out that Hopper is alive, and they make plans to go and 
                rescue him. Nancy, back in Hawkins, investigates the death of 
                the local cheerleader, and a witch party ensues for Eddie 
                Munson. He is believed to be the prime suspect in the death 
                of the cheerleader, last seen at his home, and also where her 
                body was discovered.
            </p>

            <h4>Part Two: Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Chapter 6</h4>

            <p>
                In chapter 4, we find Eleven on the run after being charged 
                with assault of her classmate. Eleven is taken by Dr. Owens 
                from the police, where they then talk at a diner about the 
                return of her powers. Back in Hawkins, Nancy continues to dig 
                up dirt on the evil in Hawkins and finds an unexpected 
                connection with the local crazy of the town. She then brings 
                her friend Robin in on the investigation to question him at 
                the nearby insane asylum. Meanwhile, in Hawkins, two other 
                bodies have been found, and a connection to the murders has 
                also been discovered. And in that discovery, Max learns that 
                she is the next target.
            </p>

            <p>
                As Max learns her possible fate, the search for a stop to 
                these murders continues. Eddie Munson, who did not commit the 
                murders, is found.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through Chapter 5 and 6, Eleven is taken to a secure lab in 
                Nevada where she has to confront her past in order to regain 
                her powers. While Eleven is in Nevada, Mike and Will continue 
                to search for her whereabouts, with clues left by agents. 
                Mike, Will and Jonathan use one of their old connections, 
                Susie, a hacker who has a long distance relationship with 
                Dustin. While they are on their way to meet Susie, back in 
                Hawkins, Steve and the others have found a way into the 
                upside down. There Steve and some of the others explore 
                their findings with the connections they have learned from 
                up above. And a last check on Hopper finds his escape plan 
                unachievable and leaves Joyce and Murray having to come up 
                with plan B.
            </p>

            <h4>Part Three: Chapter 7, Chapter 8, and Chapter 9</h4>

            <p>
                For the final chapters, we find the drama coming to 
                a head. With everyone on edge with their own storylines, 
                everything must come together.
            </p>

            <p>
                We find Eleven close to securing the rest of her 
                powers, but the United States Army has labeled her as 
                the villain and has come to take her out. While Eleven 
                battles to fight for her powers, Mike, Will, and Jonathan 
                are driving as fast as they can to get to her before it’s 
                too late. And back in Hawkins, the gang is doing everything 
                they can to stop Vecna from completing the final murder.
            </p>

            <p>
                While turmoil brews across state lines, it continues over 
                in Russia. Joyce and Murray are running out of time to 
                save Hopper; they’ve come up with a plan, but it is full 
                of risks. Hopper is set to die while fighting a demagorgan 
                in a Russian soldier’s comedy. He also has a plan, which is 
                also full of risks. Their plan eventually works, Hopper is 
                rescued, and Joyce and he are finally reunited. But their 
                fight isn’t over. They come to realize they have to go back to 
                their prison, as the upside down is connected in Russia, and 
                the only way to help the kids is to stay and fight.
            </p>

            <p>
                While Joyce, Hopper, and Murray fight in Russia, the fight 
                also continues in Hawkins and in Nevada. In Hawkins, the gang 
                has come up with a “plan” to take down Vecna in order to 
                save Max. Half of them will go to the Upside Down while the 
                other half will stay up top, causing distractions from the 
                other side. And back in Nevada, Will and Mike finally get 
                to Eleven, where she has warned them of the dangers in 
                Hawkins, and she must help now. In the last episode, the 
                fighting takes place. With all three locations being 
                crucial to the fight, ultimately, it takes all three to 
                take down Vecna.
