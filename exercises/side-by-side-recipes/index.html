                            Dippy eggs and soldiers are a classic 
                            British breakfast that may seem like just 
                            eggs and toast, but the experience is 
                            completely different. Soft, creamy yolks 
                            meet thin, buttery toast strips for dipping, 
                            creating a breakfast thatâ€™s comforting and 
                            satisfying. This recipe shows you exactly how 
                            to get the eggs and toast just right every time.
